# TurnipOS

This is an intentionally OS-like-but-not-quite-okay-it's-really-not project. It will probably serve as a friendly introduction to OS-like thinking.

Note: this project has **only** been built for GNU/Linux. On any other operating system, building it will likely **not work**, but I have tried to make it simple to port by minimizing the number of functions I use that are exclusive to Linux. However, filesystem code will have to be reworked if a Windows or macOS version is to be made.
